    description._


    The __host__(FQDN) showed in this API's base url is just an example. 

    It is an OB/Country responsibility to provide the final FQDN/Host. HTTPS
    protocol is mandatory, and a non-self signed certificate MUST be offered. A
    list of Recognised root CAs will be provided.


    Please notice a main goal is to be aware of the following error blocks


    __Error blocks__:

      1. STB cannot be matched with an user
      2. A match exists but Open Platform(OP) registering failed
      3. Internal errors. Example - DB issues
      4. Bad parameters. Example - MAC with wrong format.


    __Proprietary HTTP status codes__:


    | Code | Meaning |

    | ------- | -------- |

    | 454   | STB not found    |

    | 554   | STB/User found but register failed |
